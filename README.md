# CTJ : Level Up Your Career - A Canadian Job Site for Tech Professionals with an XP Bar

Our project for Hack The Break 2023. We have created a job site, targetted for those working in Canada based tech jobs. We started by scraping job postings for LinkedIn, using https://github.com/tomquirk/linkedin-api, which uses the Voyager endpoints to find job postings and their relevent fields. 

We set up an SQL server to store all our data and a TCP server program to handle all the http requests to the server. We realize that applying for jobs can be tiring, and took inspiration from Dulingo, and added an XP bar, to signify progress. This will help our users have some instant gratification, allowing them to push through the harsh and long application cycle. 

We used Python, SQL, HTML, CSS & JS for this project. 

Cheers,

Anton, Duncan, Leo, Nick.
